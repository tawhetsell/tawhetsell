### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Travis Whetsell. I am currently an assistant professor in the School of Public Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I completed my Ph.D. in public policy and management at the John Glenn College of Public Affairs at The Ohio State University. My research focuses on three general areas: network governance, science and technology policy, and public philosophy. This site primarily contains things relevant to my research as a computational social scientist and focuses primarily on my projects utilizing social network analysis.
