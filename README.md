## About
I am a computational social scientist working as an assistant professor at Georgia Tech. I study inter-organizational and inter-personal networks in the public sector (network governance), science and technology policy, and philosophy of public administration. This github site contains data and code repositories for several of my published articles. I also post some of my side projects here.
